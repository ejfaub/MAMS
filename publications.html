										<h3>Cory Hage Mefforda, Yao Qiaoa, Marco Salviato</h3><br>
										This work proposes an investigation on the scaling of the structural strength of
										polymer/graphene nanocomposites. To this end, fracture tests on geometrically scaled
										Single Edge Notch Bending (SENB) specimens with varying contents of graphene were
										conducted to study the effects of nanomodification on the scaling.
										It is shown that, while the strength of the pristine polymer scales according to Linear
										Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), this is not the case for nanocomposites, even for
										very low graphene contents. In fact, small specimens exhibited a more pronounced
										ductility with limited scaling and a significant deviation from LEFM whereas larger
										specimens behaved in a more brittle way, with scaling of nominal strength closer to the
										one predicted by LEFM.
										This behavior, due to the significant size of the Fracture Process Zone (FPZ) compared
										to the specimen size, needs to be taken into serious consideration. In facts, it is
										shown that, for the specimen sizes investigated in this work, neglecting the non-linear
										effects of the FPZ can lead to an underestimation of the fracture energy as high as
										113%, this error decreasing for increasing specimen sizes.

										<h3> Chiara Ceccatoa, Marco Salviato, Carlo Pellegrinoa, Gianluca Cusatis</h3> <br>
										Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP) have been widely used in different civil engineering applications to enhance
										the performance of concrete structures through flexural, shear or compression strengthening. One
										of the most common and successful use of FRP sheets can be found in the confinement of existing concrete
										vertical elements which need rehabilitation or increased capacity in terms of strength and ductility.
										However, efficient design of FRP retrofitting urges the development of computational models capable of
										accurately capturing (a) the interaction between the axial strains and lateral expansion of concrete with
										the corresponding stress increase in the external jacket; and (b) the fracturing behavior of the FRP jacket.
										In this study, experimental data gathered from the literature and relevant to FRP-confined columns are
										simulated by adopting the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) and the Spectral Microplane Model
										(SMPM), recently developed to simulate concrete failure and fracture of anisotropic materials, respectively.
										LDPM models the meso-scale interaction of coarse aggregate particles and it has been extensively
										calibrated and validated with comparison to a large variety to experimental data under both quasi-static
										and dynamic loading conditions but it has not been fully validated with reference to low confinement
										compressive stress states, relevant to the targeted application. This task, along with the calibration of
										SMPM for FRP, is pursued in the present research. The results show that, with the improvement of the
										existing LDPM constitutive equations to account for low confinement effects, LDPM and SMPM are able to
										predict the concrete material response governed by the nonlinear interaction of confined vertical members
										strengthened by means of externally bonded FRP composites.

										<h3>Congrui Jin, Marco Salviato, Weixin Li, Gianluca Cusatis</h3><br>
										This contribution investigates the extension of the microplane formulation to the description
										of transversely isotropic materials such as shale rock, foams, unidirectional composites,
										and ceramics. Two possible approaches are considered: (1) the spectral
										decomposition of the stiffness tensor to define the microplane constitutive laws in terms
										of energetically orthogonal eigenstrains and eigenstresses and (2) the definition of
										orientation-dependent microplane elastic moduli. The first approach, as demonstrated
										previously, provides a rigorous way to tackle anisotropy within the microplane framework,
										which is reviewed and presented herein in a clearer manner; whereas the second
										approach represents an approximation which, however, makes the formulation of nonlinear
										constitutive equations much simpler. The efficacy of the second approach in modeling
										the macroscopic elastic behavior is compared to the thermodynamic restrictions of the
										anisotropic parameters showing that a significant range of elastic properties can be modeled
										with excellent accuracy. Further, it is shown that it provides a very good approximation
										of the microplane stresses provided by the first approach, with the advantage of a
										simpler formulation. It is concluded that the spectral stiffness decomposition represents
										the best approach in such cases as for modeling composites, in which accurately capturing
										the elastic behavior is important. The introduction of orientation-dependent microplane
										elastic moduli provides a simpler framework for the modeling of transversely
										isotropic materials with remarked inelastic behavior, as in the case, for example, of shale
										rock.

											<h3>Marco Salviato &amp Michele Zappalorto</h3><br>
											In this work, a unified solution approach is proposed for the analytical evaluation of the stress fields close
											to notches under antiplane shear and torsion loadings, which allows a large variety of notch problems to
											be tackled. The method is based on the complex potential approach for antiplane elasticity combined
											with the use of proper conformal mappings. In particular, it is shown that a well defined analytical link
											does exist between the complex potential to be used to determine stresses and the first derivative of the
											conformal mapping used to mathematically describe the notch profile. This makes some methodologies
											such as Schwarz-Christoffel transformation, which allows describing any polygonal domain automatically,
											very attractive for the direct solution of notch problems. A bulk of solutions are provided to support this
											finding, from cracks and pointed notches, to radiused notches. In addition, the accuracy of each proposed
											solution is discussed in detail taking advantage of a bulk of results from FE analyses.

											Static and dynamic analysis of the fracture tests of fiber composites in hydraulically servo-controlled testing machines currently in use shows that their grips are much too soft and light for observing the postpeak softening. Based on static analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics, confirmed by dynamic analysis of the test setup as an open system, far stiffer and heavier grips are proposed. Tests of compact-tension fracture specimens of woven carbon-epoxy laminates prove this theoretical conclusion. Sufficiently, stiff grips allow observation of a stable postpeak softening, even under load-point displacement control. Dynamic analysis of the test setup as a closed system with proportional-integrative-differential (PID)-controlled input further indicates that the controllability of postpeak softening under crack-mouth opening displacement (CMOD) control is improved not only by increasing the grip stiffness but also by increasing the grip mass. The fracture energy deduced from the area under the measured complete load-deflection curve with stable postpeak is shown to agree with the fracture energy deduced from the size effect tests of the same composite, but the size effect tests also provide the material characteristic length of quasibrittle (or cohesive) fracture mechanics. Previous suspicions of dynamic snapback in the testing of stiff specimens of composites are dispelled. Finally, the results show the stress- or strain-based failure criteria for fiber composites to be incorrect, and fracture mechanics, of the quasibrittle type, to be perfectly applicable.

											<h3>Marco Salviato, Kedar Kirane, Shiva Esna Ashari, Zdenek P. Bazant, Gianluca Cusatis</h3><br>
											Design of large composite structures requires understanding the scaling of their mechanical properties,
											an aspect often overlooked in the literature on composites.<br>
											This contribution analyzes, experimentally and numerically, the intra-laminar size effect of textile
											composite structures. Test results of geometrically similar Single Edge Notched specimens made of [0+]8
											epoxy/carbon twill 2  2 laminates are reported. Results show that the nominal strength decreases with
											increasing specimen size and that the experimental data can be fitted well by Bazant's size effect law,
											allowing an accurate identification of the intra-laminar fracture energy of the material, Gf.<br>
											The importance of an accurate estimation of Gf in situations where intra-laminar fracturing is the main
											energy dissipation mechanism is clarified by studying numerically its effect on crashworthiness of
											composite tubes.<br>
											Simulations demonstrate that, for the analyzed geometry, a decrease of the fracture energy to 50% of
											the measured value corresponds to an almost 42% decrease in plateau crushing load. Further, assuming a
											vertical stress drop after the peak, a typical assumption of strength-based constitutive laws implemented
											in most commercial Finite Element codes, results in an strength underestimation of the order of 70%.<br>
											The main conclusion of this study is that measuring accurately fracture energy and modeling correctly
											the fracturing behavior of textile composites, including their quasi-brittleness, is key. This can be
											accomplished neither by strength- or strain-based approaches, which neglect size effect, nor by LEFM
											which does not account for the finiteness of the Fracture Process Zone.

												This contribution proposes a general constitutive model to simulate the orthotropic stiffness, pre-peak
												nonlinearity, failure envelopes, and the post-peak softening and fracture of textile composites.
												<br>Following the microplane model framework, the constitutive laws are formulated in terms of stress and
												strain vectors acting on planes of several orientations within the material meso-structure. The model
												exploits the spectral decomposition of the orthotropic stiffness tensor to define orthogonal strain modes
												at the microplane level. These are associated to the various constituents at the mesoscale and to the
												material response to different types of deformation. Strain-dependent constitutive equations are used
												to relate the microplane eigenstresses and eigenstrains while a variational principle is applied to relate
												the microplane stresses at the mesoscale to the continuum tensor at the macroscale.
												<br>The application of the model to a twill 2  2 shows that it can realistically predict its uniaxial as well as
												multi-axial behavior. Furthermore, the model shows excellent agreement with experiments on the axial
												crushing of composite tubes, this capability making it a valuable design tool for crashworthiness applications.
												<br>The formulation is computationally efficient, easy to calibrate and adaptable to other kinds of composite
												architectures such as 2D and 3D braids or 3D woven textiles.

											<h3> Kedar Kirane, Marco Salviato, Zdenek P. Bazant</h3><br>
												A multiscale model based on the framework of microplane theory is developed to predict the elastic and fracturing
												behavior of woven composites from the mesoscale properties of the constituents and the weave architecture. The
												effective yarn properties are obtained by means of a simplified mesomechanical model of the yarn, based on a mixed
												series and parallel coupling of the fibers and of the polymer within the yarns. As a novel concept, each of the several
												inclined or aligned segments of an undulating fill and warp yarn is represented by a triad of orthogonal microplanes,
												one of which is normal to the yarn segment while another is normal to the plane of the laminate. The constitutive law
												is defined in terms of the microplane stress and strain vectors. The elastic and inelastic constitutive behavior is
												defined using the microplane strain vectors which are the projections of the continuum strain tensor. Analogous to the
												principle of virtual work used in previous microplane models, a strain energy density equivalence principle is employed
												here to obtain the continuum level elastic and inelastic stiffness tensors, which in turn yield the continuum level stress
												tensor. The use of strain vectors rather than tensors makes the modeling conceptually clearer as it allows capturing the
												orientation of fiber failures, yarn cracking, matrix microcracking, and interface slip. Application of the new
												microplane-triad model for a twill woven composite shows that it can realistically predict all the orthotropic elastic
												constants and the strength limits for various layups. In contrast with the previous (nonmicroplane) models, the formulation
												can capture the size effect of quasi-brittle fracture with a finite fracture process zone (FPZ). Explicit finite-element
												analysis gives a realistic picture of progressive axial crushing of a composite tubular crush can initiated by a divergent
												plug. The formulation is applicable to widely different weaves, including plain, twill, and satin weaves, and is easily
												extensible to more complex architectures such as hybrid weaves as well as two-and three-dimensional braids.

												An accurate prediction of the orthotropic elastic constants of woven composites from the
												constituent properties can be achieved if the representative unit cell is subdivided into
												a large number of finite elements. But this would be prohibitive for microplane analysis of
												structures consisting of many representative unit cells when material damage alters the elastic
												constants in each time step in every element. This study shows that predictions almost as accurate
												and sufficient for practical purposes can be achieved in a much simpler and more efficient manner
												by adapting to woven composites the well-established microplane model, in a partly similar way as
												recently shown for braided composites. The undulating fill and warp yarns are subdivided into
												segments of different inclinations and, in the center of each segment, one microplane is placed
												normal to the yarn. As a new idea, a microplane triad is formed by adding two orthogonal microplanes
												parallel to the yarn, one of which is normal to the plane of the laminate. The benefit of the
												microplane approach is that it is easily extendable to damage and fracture. The model is shown to
												give realistic predictions of the full range of the orthotropic elastic constants for plain, twill,
												and satin weaves and is extendable to hybrid weaves and braids.

										<h3>Yewang Su, Zdenˇek P. Bažant, Youxuan Zhao, Marco Salviato, Kedar Kirane</h3><br>
										While dynamic comminution is of interest to many processes and situations, this work is focused
										on the projectile impact onto concrete walls, in which predictions have been hampered by the problem of
										the so-called ‘dynamic overstress’. Recently, in analogy with turbulence, Bažant and Caner modeled the
										overstress as an additional viscous stress generated by apparent viscosity that accounts for the energy dissipation
										due to kinetic comminution of concrete into small particles at very high shear strain rate. Their viscosity
										estimation, however, was approximate since it did not satisfy the energy balance exactly. Here their model
										is extended and refined by ensuring that the drop of local kinetic energy of high shear strain rate of forming
										particles must be exactly equal to the energy dissipated by interface fracture of these particles. The
										basic hypothesis is that the interface fracture occurs instantly, as soon as the energy balance is satisfied.
										Like in the preceding work, this additional apparent viscosity is a power function of the rate of the deviatoric
										strain invariant. But here the power exponent is different, equal to −7/3, and the apparent viscosity is
										found to be proportional also to the time derivative of the rate of that invariant, i.e., to the second derivative
										of the shear strain. It is assumed that the interface fracture that comminutes the material into small particles
										occurs instantly, as soon as the local kinetic energy of shear strain rate in the forming particles becomes equal
										to the energy required to form interface fractures. The post-comminution behavior, including subsequent further
										comminution and clustering into bigger particle groups to release the kinetic energy that is being dissipated
										by inter-group friction, is discussed and modeled. The present formulation makes it possible to eliminate
										the artificial damping of all types, which is normally embedded in commercial finite element codes but is not
										predictive since it is not justified physically. With the aforementioned improvements, and after implementation
										into the new microplane model M7 for fracturing damage in concrete (which includes the quasi-static
										rate effects), the finite element predictions give superior agreement with the measured exit velocities of steel
										projectiles penetrating concrete walls of different thicknesses and with the measured depths of penetration
										into concrete blocks by projectiles of different velocities. Finally it is pointed out that the theory presented
										may also be used to predict proximate fragmentation and permeability enhancement of gas shale by powerful electric pulsed-arc explosions in the borehole

											<br>
											Although spectacular advances in hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, have
											taken place and many aspects are well understood by now, the topology, geometry, and
											evolution of the crack system remain an enigma and mechanicians wonder: Why fracking
											works? Fracture mechanics of individual fluid-pressurized cracks has been clarified but
											the vital problem of stability of interacting hydraulic cracks escaped attention. First,
											based on the known shale permeability, on the known percentage of gas extraction from
											shale stratum, and on two key features of the measured gas outflow which are (1) the time
											to peak flux and (2) the halftime of flux decay, it is shown that the crack spacing must be
											only about 0.1 m. Attainment of such a small crack spacing requires preventing localization
											in parallel crack systems. Therefore, attention is subsequently focused on the classical
											solutions of the critical states of localization instability in a system of cooling or
											shrinkage cracks. Formulated is a hydrothermal analogy which makes it possible to
											transfer these solutions to a system of hydraulic cracks. It is concluded that if the hydraulic
											pressure profile along the cracks can be made almost uniform, with a steep enough
											pressure drop at the front, the localization instability can be avoided. To achieve this
											kind of profile, which is essential for obtaining crack systems dense enough to allow gas
											escape from a significant portion of kerogen-filled nanopores, the pumping rate (corrected
											for the leak rate) must not be too high and must not be increased too fast. Furthermore,
											numerical solutions are presented to show that an idealized system of circular
											equidistant vertical cracks propagating from a horizontal borehole behaves similarly. It
											is pointed out that one useful role of the proppants, as well as the acids that promote creation
											of debris in the new cracks, is to partially help to limit crack closings and thus
											localization. To attain the crack spacing of only 0.1 m, one must imagine formation of
											hierarchical progressively refined crack systems. Compared to new cracks, the system of
											pre-existing uncemented natural cracks or joints is shown to be slightly more prone to
											localization and thus of little help in producing the fine crack spacing required. So, from
											fracture mechanics viewpoint, what makes fracking work?–the mitigation of fracture
											localization instabilities. This can also improve efficiency by fracturing more shale.
											Besides, it is environmentally beneficial, by reducing flowback per m3 of gas. So is the
											reduction of seismicity caused by dynamic fracture instabilities (which are more severe
											in underground CO2 sequestration).

											thus are excluded from the statistics of the overload. The predictions of the theory are
											validated by available test data on glass–epoxy composites and on borosilicate and sodalime

											The fiber bundle model is widely used in probabilistic modeling of various phenomena across different
											engineering fields, from network analysis to earthquake statistics. In structural strength analysis, this
											model is an essential part of extreme value statistics that governs the left tail of the cumulative
											probability density function of strength. Based on previous nano-mechanical arguments, the cumulative
											probability distribution function of strength of each fiber constituting the bundle is assumed to exhibit a
											power-law left tail. Each fiber (or element) of the bundle is supposed to be subjected to the same relative
											displacement (parallel coupling). The constitutive equations describing various fibers are assumed to be
											related by a radial affinity while no restrictions are placed on their particular form. It is demonstrated
											that, even under these most general assumptions, the power-law left tail is preserved in the bundle and
											the tail exponent of the bundle is the sum of the exponents of the power-law tails of all the fibers. The
											results have significant implications for the statistical modeling of strength of quasibrittle structures.

											<br>
											In this work the mixed mode fracture behaviour (I + II) of an epoxy/nanoclay nanocomposite
											system is analysed, discussing the results from Single Edge Notch Bending tests. It is
											found that nanomodification significantly enhances the fracture toughness of the epoxy
											resin on the entire range of mixed mode loadings (from pure mode I to pure mode II),
											improvements depend however on the mode mixity. <br>
											Experimental results are compared to theoretical predictions based on different criteria
											for mixed mode fracture in brittle homogeneous materials. As expected, it is found that,
											while the data from pure epoxy are satisfactorily predicted almost independently of the
											adopted approach, the agreement is much worse in the case of nanomodified materials.
											Explanations of this behaviour can be found in the emergence of additional microscale
											and nanoscale toughening mechanisms due to nanomodification not properly described
											by conventional models.

											The most appealing feature of nanofilled polymers is the perspective of obtaining surprisingly high
											mechanical properties at low nanofiller volume fractions. The knowledge of nanostructure–property relationships
											is however essential for the design of these materials. <br>
											In the present work, a model for the critical hydrostatic tension related to nanoparticle debonding is
											presented. The model accounts for some important issues inherently related to the nanoscale with particular
											reference to surface elastic stresses on the nanoparticle periphery and the emergence of a zone of
											altered chemistry surrounding the nanoparticle. The analytical solution suggests that the range of nanoparticle
											radii where interfacial effects do affect the solution is limited to the nanometer scale. In more
											details, considering the interphase and surface elastic properties used in the analysis, it has been found
											that for stiff particles with radius between 10 nm and 100 nm (silica, alumina and other metal oxide
											nanoparticles) the prominent role is played by the interphase elastic properties. Surface elastic constants
											were found to have, instead, only a negligible effect.

													In this work, an experimental investigation of the notch effect on clay-modified epoxy resins is carried out,
													iscussing the results from Single Edge Notch Bending tests and Double Edge Notch Tension tests on notched components.
													It is found that when the notch root radius is greater than a limit value, which depends on the clay content, the
													brittle failure of notched nanomodified specimens is controlled by the material strength. Under this circumstance
													nanomodification, while enhancing the polymer fracture toughness, might have a detrimental effect on the strength
													of notched components. This study brings to light a new feature of nanomodification according to which particular
													care should be used when using nanomodified resins for structural applications in the presence of notches or holes.

												In preceding studies, the type of cumulative probability distribution functions (cdf) of
												strength and of static lifetime of quasibrittle structures, including their tails, was mathematically
												derived from atomistic scale arguments based on nano-scale cracks propagating by many small, activation
												energy-controlled, random breaks of atomic bonds in the nanostructure. It was shown that a quasibrittle
												structure (of positive geometry) must be modeled by a finite (rather than infinite) weakest-link model,
												and that the cdf of structural strength as well as lifetime varies from nearly Gaussian to Weibullian
												as a function of structure size and shape. Excellent agreement with the observed distributions of
												structural strength and static lifetime was demonstrated. Based on the same theoretical framework, the
												present paper formulates the statistics of the residual structural strength, which is the strength after
												the structure has been subjected to sustained loading. A strength degradation equation is derived based
												on Evans law for static crack growth during sustained loading. It is shown that the rate of strength
												degradation is not constant but continuously increasing. The cdf of residual strength of one RVE is shown
