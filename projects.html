		<h2>Cohesive Zone modeling and size effect in SENT</h2>
		<h4>Antonio Alessandro Deleo, Abhishek Das, Marco Salviato</h4>
		<br>
		<p>
		The aim of this project is to develop a better understanding of how the variation
		in the extent of development of the FPZ for different sizes affects their fracture
		behavior. The size effect studies are being conducted through Finite Element based
		Cohesive Zone Modeling. A better insight into their size effects will lead to
		improved utilization of these materials in structural applications. The plot
		alongside shows the variation of the failure nominal stress with the specimen width,
		obtained from cohesive zone simulations for SENT samples for two different cohesive
		law (traction separation law) shapes - inward and outward, for the same value of
		Fracture Energy. It is interesting to observe that for very small sized specimens
		they have similar failure stress values. Subsequently, they diverge for intermediate
		specimen sizes before converging again to similar values for large sample dimensions.
		The final convergence towards the end can be attributed to the FPZ being fully
		developed for specimens beyond a particular size.

		<h2>Composite Origami: Foldable Structures based on Tachi-Miura-Polyhedron Origami Technique</h2>
		<h4>Antonio Alessandro Deleo, James E. O’Neil, Hiromi Yasuda, Jinkyu Yang, and Marco Salviato</h4>
		<br>
		<p>
			The goal of this project is to prove the possibility of design and manufacture novel
			types of foldable – yet stiff – structures based on the Tachi-Miura-Polyhedron (TMP)
			origami. This type of origami has received significant attention from the scientific
			and engineering community due to its unique features such as rigid foldability, high
			compactness, and tunable stiffness. The kinematics of this TMP structure is being
			investigated in order to achieve extraordinary mechanical properties in terms of
			robust deployability. Several prototypes have been tested with hinges made out of
			both dry and wet fibers, using glass, carbon, and kevlar materials.

		<h2>Computational Parametric Study using Cohesive Zone Modeling and Size Effect Law:
			Effects of different traction-separation softening curves and materials parameters</h2>
		<h4>Antonio Alessandro Deleo and Marco Salviato</h4>
		<br>
		<p>
		An extensive parametric study sweeping both material and geometrical parameters is
		being performed using size effect law (SEL) and Cohesive Zone Modeling (CZM). These
		simulations and recent experimental results suggest that the cohesive law of
		composites is bi-linear and that the Fracture Process Zone (FPZ) may be almost fully
		developed already for laboratory-sized specimens. If this is true, the work done by
		Bazant (1984) and Cusatis (2009) needs to be extended for both smaller and larger
		scale asymptotes and for various ratios of Gf / GF. The goal of this project is to
		formulate a master curve that can be used for quick, yet accurate, estimation of
		energy and strength parameters.

		<h2>Delamination Resistance and Size Effect in DFC structures</h2>
		<h4>Rohith Jayaram, Seunghyun Ko, Jinkyu Yang, Marco Salviato</h4>
		<p>In this project, an experimental and numerical approach is devised to
			investigate delamination resistance in discontinuous fiber composites (DFC).
			Owing to the high degree of randomization in material properties in DFC’s,
			conventional testing methodologies such as the double cantilever beam (DCB)
			and end-notched flexure (ENF) that are used to characterize Mode-I and
			Mode-II interlaminar failure may fail to address the non-linear behavior
			during delamination resistance. This project aims to use an energy-based
			approach, to model the delamination resistance in geometrically scaled DFC
			specimens, though experimental and finite element models to derive the
			interlaminar fracture toughness values, GI and GII, during Mode-I and
			Mode-II failures.

		<h2>Environmental Fatigue Behavior of Graphene Nanocomposite</h2>
		<h4>Yao Qiao </h4>
		<br>
		<p>Fatigue or environmental degradation needs to be taken into serious consideration
			since more than 60% of aircraft components fail because of that. In order to overcome
			this issue, graphene sheets can be an excellent candidate which is expected to reduce
			the coefficient of water diffusion of the polymer and minimize the water absorption.
			As a result, this may provide better resistance to environment aggression hence
			improved durability. </p>

		<h2>Fracture and Damage in Hybrid composites</h2>
		<h4> Abhishek Das, Antonio Alessandro Deleo, Marco Salviato</h4>
		<br>
		<p>While traditional Carbon fiber composites have very high stiffness and strength,
			they show brittle behavior and are prone to catastrophic failure. Hybrid composites
			featuring both Glass and Carbon fibers retain some of the stiffness and strength
			of Carbon fibers and the ductile behavior of Glass fibers. Such composites can be
			useful in a wide range of applications which require lightweight stiff materials
			and at the same time cannot accommodate catastrophic failure. Uniaxial tension and
			some basic damage behavior of such composites have been studied by researchers
			hitherto, but the mechanics the failure of notched or cracked Carbon Glass hybrids
			have not been explored substantially. The current project is an effort towards
			bridging this gap and throwing some light on the damage and failure mechanics of
			pre-cracked or notched Carbon-Glass hybrids and studying their size effects and
			how the presence of a major defect affects the failure profile of the material.</p>

		<h2>Multi-axial Fatigue Failure Behavior of notched GFRP laminate</h2>
		<h4>Yao Qiao</h4>
		<br>
		<p>The behavior of composites under uni-axial fatigue loading has been extensively
			studied but still poorly understood. Another aspect that composite materials
			under multi-axial fatigue loading has been far less investigated. The lack of
			experimental data and models is even more evident in the case of multi-axial
			fatigue of notched composite structure. The goal of this project is to investigate
			the damage mechanisms and model the fatigue failure behavior of notched GFRP
			laminate under multi-axial fatigue loading.</p>

		<h2>Safety and certification of discontinuous fiber composite (DFC) structures</h2>
		<h4>Seunghyun Ko</h4>
		<br>
		<p>Recently, discontinuous fiber composites (DFC) made of chopped and randomly distributed
			fibers brought a significant attention to the composite community. It has appealing
			properties such as ease of manufacturing, resistance to delamination, and near
			quasi-isotropic mechanical properties. However, due to its complex morphology, the
			mechanics of DFC is largely unknown. This project aims to characterize the main failure
			mechanisms occurring in DFC using X-ray CT scanner, and develop a physically-based
			computational modeling of DFCs. The findings of this study will contribute to the safety
			and certification of DFC structures.</p>

		<h2>Spectral Stiffness Microplane Model of Unidirectional Composites</h2>
		<h4>Sean Phenisee</h4>
		<p>Application of composite materials have been exponentially growing
			attributed to their outstanding and tailorable mechanical properties.
			However, their orthotropic nature, complicated damage mechanism, and
			nonlinear softening makes them hard to predict a failure. Our aim on
			this project is to capture the softening behavior of this complicated
			material in order to simulate the fracture mechanism. Key features in this
			model are spectral decomposition and a projection of strain and stress to
			the microplane which is a plane forming a sphere around a point of interest
			in a meso-structure. Spectral decomposition allows to isolate the modes in
			the constitutive behavior of the material. These modes can actually be
			interpreted with physical meaning. By doing so, the orthotropic behavior
			of the material can be simplified in each mode. The stress-strain analysis
			on each microplane helps to capture the complexity of the meso-structure.<br>

		<h2>Structural Analysis on a Thin Woven Textile Composite</h2>
		<h4> Sean Phenisee</h4>
		<p>The development of deployable structures is an active area of research.
			The flexibility requirements along with the need for lightweight structures
			drive the choice of the material which has to provide compliance without
			damaging and failing at large deformations. Thin composites are generally
			adopted because of their high flexibility and strength. However, the low
			thickness and the presence of holes and notches to promote compliance may
			lead to failure during the deployment. The objective of this project is to
			study the damage initiation and failure of thin composites. Capturing the
			effects of curvature from bending is a major focus. A multi-scale framework
			with a periodic boundary condition explicitly models the microstructural
			features of composites and damage. </p>
