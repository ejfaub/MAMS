Hello all. 

This site was built and designed for the research group led by Marco Salviato out of the University of Washington's AA 
Department.

Built in part from Sphene, a bootstrap template that allowed for a responsive site and a great start.

For help, questions, concerns, or comments please contact Emma Faubion, the designer and dev of the site at ejfaubion@gmail.com
